      <h1>Difference demo between native wagtail and wagtail_srcset image tag</h1>
      <h3>
        Both images have a width of 600px. But 1px on an old device and 1px on a modern
        high pixel density device like an phone, tablet or modern computer display are
        not the same. 
      </h3>
      <div id="left_col"> 
        <p>
          This is the original wagtail image created with
          {% verbatim image_tag %}
            {% image img width-600 %}
          {% endverbatim image_tag %}.
          It looks blurry because the original image is at first scaled
          to 600px width by wagtail and stored in a image rendition. Then
          this 600px image is shown on a high pixel densitiy screen. Since
          those screens use up to 3 times as much hardware pixels to display
          those 600 browser pixels, the image is upscaled implicitly by a factor
          of 2 to 3. Ouch.
        </p>
        {% image img width-600 %}
      </div>
      <div id="right_col"> 
        <p>
          This is the image generated by
          {% verbatim image_tag %}
            {% srcset_image img width-600 %}
          {% endverbatim image_tag %}
          which should be sharper on modern
          display devices, because now 1 browser image pixel should roughly
          map to one pixel on the device again. We present the browser with
          different images size alternatives and the browser chooses the most
          appropriate size for it's devices pixel densitiy which could mean
          that a 1800px width image is displayed for a 600px width image.
